# ScriptSynthGUI
 A Web-based GUI for writing [ScriptSynth](https://github.com/spanio/scriptsynth) configuration files.

 ## Why? Why would you do this?
 ScriptSynth was designed as an easy-to-use tool for data acquisition from various hardware devices. Requiring only a YAML file, ScriptSynth vastly improves on existing solutions by allowing anyone to record data from many hardware devices and save that data to many different platforms and file types.

 This was too hard. Because people can't write YAML. Even if there's directions __and examples__ on how to do so in the ScriptSynth README.

 So I made this. I made this for people who can't read.

 ## Features
ScriptSynthGUI is a single-page app, with options on the left, and a preview of the YAML file on the right. Click the 'Save YAML' button to download the YAML file and use it with ScriptSynth.
